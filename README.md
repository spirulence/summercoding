# Cornell College Summer Coding Program

This website is for showing a daily-updated leaderboard for Cornell College's summer coding initiative. It is part of workflow that takes data from Kattis, an online judge of computer programming challenges, and puts that data into a leaderboard.

The program that takes Kattis data as an input is included in `_program`. It produces a YAML file, which is used by Jekyll to create the static website containing the leaderboard.

This website is hosted at http://summercoding.handsfreecam.com and was updated actively during the Summer and early Fall of 2016. I anticipate it will be largely silent until Spring 2017, when prep for next year's ICPC competition begins.
