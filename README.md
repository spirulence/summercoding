Cornell College Summer Coding Program

This website is for showing a daily-updated leaderboard for Cornell College's summer coding initiative.

This website is hosted at summercoding.handsfreecam.com, and was updated actively during the Summer and early Fall of 2016. I anticipate it will be largely silent until Spring 2016, when prep for next year's ICPC competition begins.
